# ROS Projects Repository üöÄ

Welcome to the **ROS Projects Repository**, where you will find a collection of projects developed using the Robot Operating System (ROS). These projects explore various robotics concepts, including simulation, sensor integration, and autonomous navigation, using tools like Gazebo and programming in C++ and Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Gazebo Simulations**: Create realistic robot simulations in virtual environments.
- **Custom ROS Nodes**: Implement nodes for controlling robot behavior and processing data.
- **Integration of Sensors**: Work with Lidar, cameras, and other sensors for advanced functionality.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Build robots capable of decision-making and autonomous operations.

## üöß Current Projects

### 1. Go Chase It!
A ball-chasing robot designed using ROS and Gazebo. This project includes:
- Designing a robot model.
- Writing ROS nodes for detecting and chasing a white ball.
- Integrating Gazebo plugins for sensors and actuators.

More projects will be added as they are developed!
